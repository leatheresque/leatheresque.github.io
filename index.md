I went to college in Brooklyn for Network Admin and Security, I got a job as a Network admin working on point of sale systems with my programming professor. I installed and configured Linux systems and accessed them remotely to configure users databases and maintain security for those systems. I eventually moved into using Linux systems and started learning more languages in order to write scripts that would help with server administration.

Since then I moved into JavaScript and learned Node.js when that came out. I worked with it for a while running websites, I mainly worked with WordPress and built custom plugins in PHP for users of that framework. I am now in the Ruby fan club, I write plugins in Ruby to extend functionality of the Jekyll framework. If you have an idea for a plugin you would like developed to work on your website feel free to contact me via email or discord and I will discuss it with you.

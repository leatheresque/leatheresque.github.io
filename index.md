  <h4 class="fw-bold text-danger-emphasis">Jekyll Development</h4>
  <p>I write plugins and themes for the Jekyll framework. You can see some of my creations over on my Github profile. I also do redesigns of old sites using Jekyll, you can view these redesigns on the <a href="https://github.com/site-redesigns" class="text-danger fw-bold" target="_blank">site-redesigns</a> github org page. I only use front end CSS and design minimally. I am more interested in creating plugins that extend your jekyll sites functionality.</p>
  <p>The First "plugin" I created was a really simple one. I was redesigning the edX MIT website (view that site here) to make it easier to go through that course. I wanted to be able to embed a simple runnable python instance that visitors to my site could change the code and run it to pass the tests themselves. You can see it on my Github profile also.</p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold text-danger-emphasis">Jekyll Themes</h4>
  <p>You can find all of these on Rubygems.org where you can install them as gems. You can also use these as templates on github by visiting their repo and clicking the button to use the template. All of these themes can be found in the <a class="text-danger fw-bold" href="https://github.com/jekyll-bootstrap" target="_blank">"Jekyll-Bootstrap"</a> org where you can view their README and follow the install instructions. Please join the discord server on the contact page if you run into any issues and I will help you..</p>

  <h4 class="fw-bold text-danger-emphasis">Jekyll Plugins</h4>
  <p>I am writing more plugins mainly ones that will showcase my backend skills, you can view the ones in the works on my github profile. They will be moved to the "Jekyll-Bootstrap" org once they are versioned and put up on rubygems available for download. The ones listed below can be downloaded via: <code style="background-color: black; color: pink; padding: 5px 13px;">gem install 'gemname'</code>

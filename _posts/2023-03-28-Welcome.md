Welcome to my gh-pages site. I am a backened developer and I write mainly in YAML,RUBY, JavaScript, Python and a couple others. If you have something you want to see get done, email me and let me know what it is so we can discuss. I have a couple of plugins and themes I created for the Jekyll framework.<!--more--> I use bootstrap v5.3 and make it simple to expand them to fit your needs. I also created an extension for VS Code to add snippets to your IDE that will make it easier to develop Bootstrap CSS sites.
